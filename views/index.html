						<h2>
							Old Town Media was formed in February 2017 by Tom McGeveran, Josh Benson and Katherine Lehr.
						</h2>
						<h2>
							Tom and Josh are long-time New York-based journalists who got their start at the Peter Kaplan-era New York Observer. The
							two ultimately ran the paper until they left in 2009 to start a new publication, Capital New York. The bootstrapped local
							news outfit attracted independent investment and became an important player covering the politics, infrastructure, cultural
							institutions and media business in New York City. Capital was acquired in 2013 by Politico, and Tom and Josh stayed on to
							run it.
						</h2> 
						<h2>
							 They were joined by Katherine, a journalist who had worked with Chuck Todd at Atlantic Media’s Hotline before going to Politico,
							where she became a multidisciplinarian with a specialty in standing up new efforts and coordinating them across the
							business, marketing, finance, tech and editorial arms of the company. She was sent to New York to partner with Josh
							and Tom on expanding Capital, and the three quickly bonded.
						</h2>
						<h2>
							Under this partnership, Politico broadened its successful program in New York and established new operations in Florida,
							New Jersey, California, Illinois and Massachusetts.
						</h2>
						<h2>
							 Katherine left Politico in 2016 to help found Matter Studios, an offshoot of Medium. That company was dissolved in early
							2017, and Katherine, Josh and Tom rejoined forces shortly thereafter to create Old Town.
